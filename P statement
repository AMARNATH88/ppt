"In our operational landscape, the business users have a recurring need for comprehensive reports, structured tabular data, and informative dashboards tailored to address audit queries and application logs within the context of Hyperion Planning. Unfortunately, the native capabilities of the application are limited, lacking the necessary features for conducting these analyses. As a consequence, this deficit prompts the business users to seek assistance from the SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) team, requiring them to manually create, organize, and visualize the pertinent data, leading to a reliance on time-consuming and resource-intensive processes to fulfill these critical data analysis requirements."
